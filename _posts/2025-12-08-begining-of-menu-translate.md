Nothing humbles a traveler faster than a local-language menu with zero translations. You sit down hungry and confident, ready for a feast, and five minutes later you are sweating over what might be chicken or absolutely not chicken. Meanwhile, the locals next to you order and their table overflows with dishes you did not even know existed—the kind you meant to try but never had the words for. They must be on the menu, right? But which ones? That frustration stings. You order anyway, but they are not what you imagine. It is not about bad food. It is about never having a real chance to choose the good stuff. When you cannot read the menu, every meal becomes a nervous coin toss instead of a story you want to tell later. Great trips deserve great food, not random plates that leave you feeling like you watched everyone else enjoy the real show while you missed the main act.

That's why I started Menu Translate.
